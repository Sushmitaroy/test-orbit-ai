🚀 Test-Orbit
AI-Powered QA & Test Automation Experiments

📌 Overview

Test-Orbit is a personal portfolio repository that showcases my hands-on exploration of AI-driven testing, quality engineering, and automation.

As a QA Automation lead, my goal with this repository is to:

Explore how Generative AI can enhance test design, automation, and quality analysis

Experiment with LangChain, LLMs, and AI agents in real-world QA scenarios

Build reusable AI utilities that support modern QA teams

This repository serves as a learning playground, experimentation space, and reference for applying AI in software testing.

🎯 Goals of This Repository

🤖 Apply Generative AI to testing problems

🧪 Improve test case generation and optimization

🛠️ Build AI-assisted QA utilities

🧠 Understand agent-based workflows (ReAct, tool-calling, LangGraph)

📈 Explore AI for quality insights & analysis

📚 Document learnings and best practices for QA engineers

🔐 Security & API Keys

This repository follows secure development practices:

❌ API keys are never committed

✅ Environment variables are used (.env)

✅ .gitignore protects secrets and local files

Refer to project-level READMEs for setup instructions.

🚧 Status

🟡 Work in Progress

This repository is continuously evolving as I:

Learn

Experiment

Refine AI use cases for QA

Expect:

Frequent updates

Experimental code

Refactors as tools evolve

📚 Who Is This For?

QA Engineers exploring AI in testing

Test Architects interested in GenAI adoption

Automation Engineers expanding into AI-assisted QA

Anyone curious about practical AI for Quality Engineering

🧠 Philosophy

“AI will not replace QA engineers —
but QA engineers who use AI will replace those who don’t.”

This repo reflects that mindset.
